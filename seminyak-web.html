            Seminyak is one of the most popular tourist towns in Bali, and for good reason. While attracting a slightly different 
            crowd than the clubbing-inclined visitors of Kuta, Seminyak and Legian offer a huge variety of chic shops, restaurants, bars, boutique hotels, 
            resorts, upscale villas, relaxing oceanside venues and more. We love this area for its great nightlife, cuisine and fun beach-town vibe.

                    Fabulous Seminyak is the centre of life for hordes of the island's expats, many of whom own boutiques, design clothes, surf, or do seemingly nothing at all.
                    It may be immediately north of Kuta and Legian, but in many respects, not the least of which is its intangible sense of style, Seminyak feels almost like it's on another island.

                    It's a dynamic place, home to scores of restaurants and clubs and a wealth of creative, designer shops and galleries. World-class hotels line the beach, and what a beach it is – as wide and sandy as Kuta's but less crowded.Seminyak seamlessly merges with Kerobokan, which is immediately north – in fact the exact border between the two is as fuzzy as most other geographic details in Bali. You could easily spend your entire holiday in Seminyak.
